# Support

This section shows how you can get help from the core dev team and the wider community.

### [#](broken-reference) Forums and Chat <a href="#forums-and-chat" id="forums-and-chat"></a>

The core development team and community are active on the following channels:

* [PX4 Discuss Forum (opens new window)](https://discuss.px4.io/) - Post here first!
* [PX4 Discord (opens new window)](https://discord.gg/dronecode) - Post here if you don't get a response in discuss within a few days (include a link to your forum topic).

TIP

The Discuss Forum is much preferred because it is indexed by search engines and serves as a common knowledge base.

### [#](broken-reference) Diagnosing Problems <a href="#diagnosing-problems" id="diagnosing-problems"></a>

If you are unsure what the problem is and you need help diagnosing

* Upload logs to [Flight Log Review (opens new window)](https://logs.px4.io/)
* Open a discussion on [PX4 Discuss (opens new window)](https://discuss.px4.io/c/flight-testing/) with a flight report and links to logs.
* The dev team may prompt you to [raise an issue](broken-reference) if the problem is caused by a bug.

### [#](broken-reference) Issue & Bug Reporting <a href="#issue-bug-reporting" id="issue-bug-reporting"></a>

* Upload logs to [Flight Log Review (opens new window)](https://logs.px4.io/)
* [Open a Github Issue (opens new window)](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues). This must include a flight report with as much detail as possible (enough for the issue to be reproduced) and links to your logs on Flight review.

### [#](broken-reference) Weekly Dev Call <a href="#weekly-dev-call" id="weekly-dev-call"></a>

The [Dev Call](broken-reference) is a weekly meeting attended by the PX4 dev team to discuss platform technical details, coordinate activities and perform in-depth analysis.

There is also space in the agenda to discuss pull requests, major impacting issues and Q\&A.
