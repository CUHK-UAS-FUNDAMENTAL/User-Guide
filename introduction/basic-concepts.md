# Basic Concepts

This topic provides a basic introduction to drones and using the Fundamental System (it is meant mostly for novice users but is also a good introduction for experienced users).

If you are already familiar with the basic concepts, you can move on to [Basic Assembly](../.gitbook/assets/assembly) to learn how to wire your specific autopilot hardware. To load firmware and set up the vehicle with _QGroundControl_, see [Basic Configuration](../.gitbook/assets/config).

### [#](broken-reference) What is a Drone? <a href="#what-is-a-drone" id="what-is-a-drone"></a>

A drone is an unmanned "robotic" vehicle that can be remotely or autonomously controlled.

Drones are used for many [consumer, industrial, government and military applications (opens new window)](https://px4.io/ecosystem/commercial-systems/). These include (non exhaustively): aerial photography/video, carrying cargo, racing, search and surveying etc.

Different types of drones are used for air, ground, sea, and underwater. These are (more formally) referred to as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV), Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV).

The "brain" of the drone is called an autopilot. It consists of _flight stack_ software running on _vehicle controller_ ("flight controller") hardware.

Some drones also have a separate on-vehicle [companion computer](broken-reference). These provide powerful general-purpose computing platform for networking, computer vision, and many other tasks.
