# Basic Concepts

This topic offers a fundamental insight into drones and the utilization of the Fundamental System, catering predominantly to novice users while also serving as a beneficial primer for seasoned individuals.

Drones, synonymous with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), have garnered a pivotal role across diverse sectors owing to their adaptability and proficiency in executing tasks either remotely or autonomously.&#x20;

The Fundamental System encompasses both a simulation and implementation platform designed to streamline the development, assessment, and operation of Unmanned Systems, with a primary focus on drones, thereby guaranteeing the autonomous orchestration of missions.

Now, we're going to explain some key concepts that are essential in understanding the basics of Fundamental System:

### Pixhawk4 Firmware:

The Pixhawk4 firmware is pivotal within the Fundamental System, serving as the drone’s operational nucleus. It facilitates seamless interaction between the drone’s hardware and the diverse software elements within the Fundamental System, enabling precise flight control and other operational functionalities crucial for autonomous task execution.

### Software-In-The-Loop (SITL):

SITL simulation is a key feature of the Fundamental System, offering a virtual environment to validate the drone's software. This ensures any software bugs are identified and rectified early on, setting a solid foundation for subsequent stages of autonomous task planning and execution.

### Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) Simulation:

Within the Fundamental System, HITL simulation augments testing by encompassing both the drone's software and hardware. This realistic testing milieu is essential for ensuring harmonized interactions between software and hardware, crucial for reliable autonomous flight.

### Task Planning:

Task planning is the initial phase within the Fundamental System where human inputs are processed into specific tasks for the drone. The system meticulously computes the necessary flight paths and actions required, laying the groundwork for effective motion planning and autonomous task execution.

### Motion Planning:

Motion planning, facilitated by the Fundamental System, intricately sketches the optimal path for the drone while incorporating collision avoidance strategies. This is paramount for ensuring a safe and efficient autonomous flight, especially in environments with potential hindrances.

### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):

SLAM, as integrated within the Fundamental System, empowers drones with real-time mapping and localization capabilities. This is indispensable for autonomous navigation, especially in dynamic or unknown environments, enhancing the drone’s perception and situational awareness.

### ROS (Robot Operating System):

ROS, within the Fundamental System, acts as the linchpin for communication among various software components. It streamlines the development, testing, and implementation of autonomous drone missions, making the Fundamental System a robust platform for operationalizing drone technology.

The Fundamental System embodies an end-to-end solution for autonomous drone task implementation. From processing human input to task planning, motion planning with collision avoidance, and perception mapping through SLAM, it encapsulates a comprehensive suite of tools and frameworks necessary for executing autonomous drone missions accurately and efficiently. Through a harmonized interplay of these key concepts, the Fundamental System unveils a streamlined pathway for translating human inputs into successful autonomous drone task executions, marking a significant stride in the domain of autonomous UAV technology.
