# Translation

We'd love your help to translate _QGroundControl_, and our guides for PX4, _QGroundControl_ and MAVLink!

Our docs (and _QGroundControl_) use the [Crowdin (opens new window)](https://crowdin.com/) online tool for translation. Crowdin automatically imports source topics from Github and presents new and changed strings for translation and/or review (approval).

Crowdin exports the translated documents back out to Github as a "Pull Request" (which the development team periodically review and accept). The exported output contains the source document with any translated and approved text replaced with translated strings (i.e. if a string is not translated/is changed, then it will be displayed in English).

Note

The benefit of this system is that the translation closely tracks the source documents. Readers will not be mislead by old and out of date translations.

### [#](broken-reference) Special Notes <a href="#special-notes" id="special-notes"></a>

#### [#](broken-reference) Do not modify prefix text <a href="#do-not-modify-prefix-text" id="do-not-modify-prefix-text"></a>

Vuepress uses `:::` to mark the beginning of notes, tips and warning:

The text for `:::tip` or `:::warning` etc. should not be modified as it defines the colour of the notebox.

### [#](broken-reference) Adding a New Language <a href="#adding-a-new-language" id="adding-a-new-language"></a>

If the language you want to translate is not available then you will need to request it by contacting the project owner (there is a contact link on each project's home page).

WARNING

Maintaining a translation is hard! Before you ask us to create a new language, please find a few other people to help you translate!

### [#](broken-reference) Getting Help <a href="#getting-help" id="getting-help"></a>

The _Crowdin_ interface is self explanatory, but there is plenty of additional information on the [knowledgeable (opens new window)](https://support.crowdin.com/).

You can also ask for help from translators and developers in the Dronecode community using [our support channels](broken-reference).
