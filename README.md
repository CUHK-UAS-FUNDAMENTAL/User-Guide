# Fundamental System User Guide

Welcome to the Fundamental System User Guide! This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding, setting up, and operating the Fundamental System, a state-of-the-art software developed by the USR Group at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).

#### What is the Fundamental System?

The Fundamental System is a cutting-edge integrated software solution designed to facilitate the planning, control, and simulation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It is built upon Pixhawk4 Firmware and aims to deliver a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience for both developers and end-users.

#### Why Simulation is included?

Safety and efficiency are paramount in UAV operations. The Fundamental System offers various simulation modes, including Numerical Simulation, Software-in-the-Loop (SITL), and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL), allowing developers to validate algorithms and identify system defects that may not be obvious through simple unit testing.

#### What's Inside?

This guide provides step-by-step instructions, from setting up the core components to understanding advanced features like task planning, motion planning, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Whether you are a developer aiming to integrate and test algorithms or an end-user looking to perform specific inspection tasks, this guide has something for you.

#### How to Use This Guide

Navigate through the sections to find the information most relevant to your needs. Each section is designed to be both informative and actionable, guiding you through the various aspects of the Fundamental System.
